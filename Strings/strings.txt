The at() method returns an indexed character from a string.
The at() method returns the same as [].


let text = "W3Schools";
let character = text.at(0);  or text[0]  ////.at() is new and accept negative

he charAt() method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string.
The index of the first character is 0, the second 1, ...

let character = text.charAt(0);   // its old and doesnt accept negative valeu 

The charCodeAt() method returns the Unicode of the character at a specified index (position) in a string.
The index of the first character is 0, the second is 1, ....
The index of the last character is string length - 1 (See Examples below).

let text = "HELLO WORLD";   
let code = text.charCodeAt(0); //72  give the unicode 

The codePointAt() method returns the Unicode value at an index (position) in a string.
The index of the first position is 0, the second is 1, ....

charCodeAt() vs codePointAt()
charCodeAt() is UTF-16, codePointAt() is Unicode.
charCodeAt() returns a number between 0 and 65535.
Both methods return an integer representing the UTF-16 code of a character, but only codePointAt() can return the full value of a Unicode value greather 0xFFFF (65535).

The concat() method joins two or more strings.
The concat() method does not change the existing strings.
The concat() method returns a new string.

let result = text1.concat(" ", text2);

let result = text1.concat(" ", text2, " ", text3);


The endsWith() method returns true if a string ends with a specified string.
let text = "Hello world";
let result = text.endsWith("world");


The String.fromCharCode() method converts Unicode values to characters.
The String.fromCharCode() is a static method of the String object.
The syntax is always String.fromCharCode().
You cannot use myString.fromCharCode().


let text = String.fromCharCode(72, 69, 76, 76, 79); //HELLO


The includes() method returns true if a string contains a specified string.
Otherwise it returns false.
The includes() method is case sensitive.
let result = text.includes("world");

The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a value in a string.
The indexOf() method returns -1 if the value is not found.
let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
let result = text.indexOf("welcome"); //13

let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
text.indexOf("e", 5);14

let text = "Hello World \uD800";
let result = text.isWellFormed(); //false

The lastIndexOf() method returns the index (position) of the last occurrence of a specified value in a string.
The lastIndexOf() method searches the string from the end to the beginning.
The lastIndexOf() method returns the index from the beginning (position 0).

let text = "Hello planet earth, you are a great planet.";
let result = text.lastIndexOf("planet"); //34

let length = text.length; //12

The localeCompare() method compares two strings in the current locale.
The localeCompare() method returns sort order -1, 1, or 0 (for before, after, or equal).

The match() method matches a string against a regular expression **
The match() method returns an array with the matches.

text.match(/ain/);


/////  padEnd()  The padEnd() method pads a string at the end.
let text = "5";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text.padEnd(4,"x");

let padded = text.padStart(4,"0");



The repeat() method returns a string with a number of copies of a string.
The repeat() method returns a new string.

let result = text.repeat(4);


The replace() method searches a string for a value or a regular expression.
The replace() method returns a new string with the value(s) replaced.
The replace() method does not change the original string.

let text = "Visit Microsoft!";
let result = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");

The replaceAll() method searches a string for a value or a regular expression.
The replaceAll() method returns a new string with all values replaced.
The replaceAll() method does not change the original string.

text = text.replaceAll("Cats","Dogs");
text = text.replaceAll("cats","dogs");

The search() method matches a string against a regular expression **
The search() method returns the index (position) of the first match.
The search() method returns -1 if no match is found.

let position = text.search(/Blue/);


The slice() method extracts a part of a string.
The slice() method returns the extracted part in a new string.
The slice() method does not change the original string.

string.slice(start, end)
let text = "Hello world!";
let result = text.slice(0, 5); //Hello

let result = text.slice(3); //lo world!


The split() method splits a string into an array of substrings.
The split() method returns the new array.
The split() method does not change the original string.

let text = "How are you doing today?";
const myArray = text.split(" "); //['How', 'are', 'you', 'doing', 'today?']

const myArray = text.split(""); //H,o,w,...

const myArray = text.split(" ", 3); How,are,you


The substr() method extracts a part of a string.    ❌depreciated ans it uses length as 2nd para
The substr() method begins at a specified position, and returns a specified number of characters.
The substr() method does not change the original string.

let text = "Hello world!";
let result = text.substr(1, 4); //ello

let result = text.substr(2); //llo world!

The substring() method extracts characters, between two indices (positions), from a string, and returns the substring.
The substring() method extracts characters from start to end (exclusive).
The substring() method does not change the original string.
If start is greater than end, arguments are swapped: (4, 1) = (1, 4).

Key differences: slice() vs substring()
Feature	                            slice()	    substring()
Supports negative indexes	           ✅	    ❌ (negative → 0)
Swaps start & end if start > end	   ❌	    ✅ (automatic)
End index is exclusive	               ✅	    ✅
Start index can be omitted	           ✅	    ✅
Preferred in modern JS	               ✅	Less common


let result = text.toLowerCase();
let result = text.toUpperCase();


The trim() method removes whitespace from both sides of a string.
The trim() method does not change the original string.

trimEnd()  trimStart()

Good Evening,
So Today I have been going through the notes i have created on JS and revising it again. I would love to know that if i should continue revising JS or there anything specific to do.
