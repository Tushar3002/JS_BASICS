Self-Invoking Functions
An IIFE is short for an Immediately Invoked Function Expression.

An IIFE is a function that invokes itself when defined.

When is IIFE Used?
To create a private scope
To run setup code once
In older JavaScript code

Example
(function () {
  // Code to run immediately
})();

Avoid Polluting the Global Scope
Everything inside an IIFE is private to that function.

Variables inside an IIFE cannot be accessed from outside.

IIFE with Parameters
You can pass arguments into an IIFE.

Example
(function (name) {
  let text = "Hello " + name;
})("John Doe");

Named Function Expression IIFE
You can give an IIFE a name:

Example
(function greet() {
  let text = "Hello! I called myself.";
})();

greet(); // ⛔ ReferenceError
But, the name greet exists only inside the function itself, not in the outer/global scope.

Why use a named IIFE?

For self-recursion functions (calling itself repeatedly):

IIFE as a Module (Private Variables)
Example
const counter = (function () {
  let value = 0;
  return {
    increment() { value++; },
    get() { return value; }
  };
})();

counter.increment();
let x = counter.get();
